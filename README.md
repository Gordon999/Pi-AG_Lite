# Pi-AG_Lite

Beta version.

Uses Picamera, or Philips 740 or 900 webcams*, and opencv (sudo apt install python3-opencv)

Output serial Meade LX200 commands, via USB, to Arduino Autoguider https://github.com/Gordon999/Arduino-Uno-AutoGuider or RPi Pico Autoguider

(* Note there is an issue with RaspiOS and Philips webcams, you need to carry out a 'sudo rpi-update' for them to work, hopefully this will be fixed in future RaspiOS updates)
